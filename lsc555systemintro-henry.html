	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/news/sites/news/files/Assets/images/Library.png"></p>
	<h2 style="color:green;">Context</h2>
		<p>The Fairfax County Public Library system was founded in 1939. Currently it has 23 branches spread across Fairfax County. Eight of these are regional branches, fourteen are community branches, and one is designed for people with special needs. It started its online digital catalog in 2006, which has gotten bigger every year. In 2023, they had over 3 million digital loans. They use OverDrive as part of their cataloging system and an app by OverDrive called Libby to provide patrons with access to their digital collection.</p> 
		<p>As stated on their website, Fairfax County Public Library's mission statement is: "FCPL actively builds community, furthers literacy, and promotes freedom of access and expression through programming, community spaces, technology, and collections of educational and recreational resources."</p>
	<h2 style="color:green;">Users</h2>

	<h2 style="color:green;">Unique Features</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>Has five different sections promoting books that are relevant to events happening currently. These sections currently are: Black History Month, Black History for all ages, Super Bowl, Valentine's Day, and U.S. presidents and presidential history.</li>
		  <li>You can filter your results by books that are available now with no holds on them.</li>
		  <li>Has links to GoodReads reviews so you can see what the overall rating is for that particular book. When you click on this you can read the individual reviews.</li>
		  <li>When you click on a title you can see similar titles, similar authors, and similar series.</li>
		  <li>You can browse by reading level using the Lexile levels.</li>
		  <li>There is also a story finder where you can mix and match elements from a book, such as genres or themes to find similar books.</li>
		  <li>Let's you browse the website in English, Korean, or Spanish.</li>
		</ul>
	<h2 style="color:green;">Pros and Cons</h2>
	<table style="border:1px solid black;">
	  <tr>
		<th style="border:1px solid black;">Pros</th>
		<th style="border:1px solid black;">Cons</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td style="border:1px solid black;">Fairly easy to use, has lots of filtering options which make it easy to find what you're looking for. Provides all the relevant information for the book, such as author title, and publisher.</td>
		<td style="border:1px solid black;">When searching for a title, the catalog seems to search for each word individually instead of the phrase as a whole. This meant that I got results that had all of the words from the title, but they were not in the same order or even near each other. This could make it difficult if you don't know the exact title of the book you want, as you would get a lot of different results.</td>

	</table>
	<h2 style="color:green;">Improvements</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>Even though you can filter results by available now, it would be nice to be able to filter them by wait time. The wait time for these books can vary from 1 week to 6 months. Having a filter for the wait time could let you eliminate results that are going to take too long to become available.</li> 
		  <li>When I viewed the website in Spanish, there were a lot of sections that weren't translated. This could be challenging for someone who only knows Spanish. It is a cool feature but needs some work. This was also the case when viewing the website in Korean.</li>
